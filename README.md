# Beyond Unpaired Degradation Learning for Low-light Image Enhancement in ITS
## Introduction
BUDL is a beyond unpaired degrada
tion learning framework (BUDL) for low-light image enhance
ment (LLIE) in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). 
## Dataset
NTM: Please refer to the paper [Fhsi and qrcpe based low-light enhancement with application to night traffic monitoring images](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10368207/).

BDD100K: Please refer to the paper [BDD100K: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Yu_BDD100K_A_Diverse_Driving_Dataset_for_Heterogeneous_Multitask_Learning_CVPR_2020_paper.html).

You can download the file name of the BDD100K training and testing dataset through the following link

## Training
You can train the model with unpaired data. You need to specify the data path `Train`, `Test`. Then run

```c
python train.py
```

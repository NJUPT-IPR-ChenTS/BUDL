# Beyond Unpaired Degradation Learning for Low-light Image Enhancement in ITS
## Introduction
BUDL is a beyond unpaired degrada
tion learning framework (BUDL) for low-light image enhance
ment (LLIE) in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). 
## Dataset
NTM: Please refer to the paper [Fhsi and qrcpe based low-light enhancement with application to night traffic monitoring images](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10368207/).
